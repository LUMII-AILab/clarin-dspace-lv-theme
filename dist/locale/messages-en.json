At the same time, it is also hoped to significantly facilitate and accelerate development of software solutions of many other NLP tasks, especially due to re-usability of the numerous integrated processing modules (called blocks), which are equipped with uniform object-oriented interfaces."

The system receives as its input a high quality human translation of the original into Czech (from any language). It translates the Czech input into a number of languages related to Czech. The system contains at the moment 5 language pairs, 4 of them only as experiments, namely Czech into Polish, Lithuanian, Macedonian and Lower Sorbian. Unfortunately, the system cannot be tested on arbitrary texts for these language pairs due to a small size of all dictionaries. The only working language pair (and at the same time also exploitable outside of the above mentioned setup) is the fifth one, Czech to Slovak. Similarly to other MT systems, Česílko requires human post-editing. The system is being developed since 1998"

It contains over 11000 valency frames for more than 7000 verbs which occurred in the PDT or PCEDT. It is available in electronically processable format (XML) together with the aforementioned treebanks (to be viewed and edited by TrEd, the PDT/PCEDT main annotation tool), and also in more human readable form including corpus examples (see the WEBSITE link below). The main feature of the lexicon is its linking to the annotated corpora - each occurrence of each verb is linked to the appropriate valency frame with additional (generalized) information about its usage and surface morphosyntactic form alternatives."

The EngVallex lexicon is fully linked to the English side of the PCEDT parallel treebank, which is in fact the PTB re-annotated using the Prague Dependency Treebank style of annotation. The EngVallex is available in an XML format in our repository, and also in a searchable form (see the WEBSITE link below) with examples from the PCEDT."

Current version of the morphology the tagger uses is CZ11122a. The possibility to display basic frequency information about word forms and lemmas, as computed from the large Czech National Corpus. The interface allows various coding options, both for input of word forms and output (displaying) of results, in case you have difficulty entering and/or displaying the Czech characters (which are part of the Latin 2 character set).</p><p>The interface allows to pass 'Content Filtering' options to the morphological analyzer, ensuring the same set of filtering rules is applied as if using the 'batch' version.
